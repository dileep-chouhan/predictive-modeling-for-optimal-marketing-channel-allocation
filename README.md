# Predictive Modeling for Optimal Marketing Channel Allocation

**Overview:**

This project focuses on analyzing the effectiveness of various marketing channels to optimize customer acquisition and return on investment (ROI).  We develop a predictive model using historical marketing campaign data to identify the most cost-effective channels for future campaigns. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The final model provides insights into which channels yield the highest ROI, allowing for more efficient allocation of marketing resources.


**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and insights into the relative effectiveness of different marketing channels.  Additionally, the script generates several visualization files (e.g., `channel_roi.png`, `feature_importance.png`) depicting key findings from the analysis. These visualizations are saved in the `output` directory.


**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: Contains the input data used for the analysis.
* `src/`: Contains the Python source code.
* `models/`: Stores trained models (if applicable).
* `output/`: Stores generated visualizations and other output files.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies.
* `main.py`: The main script to run the analysis.
